# Overview
For the analysis information was provided from the Kickstarter campaign dataset where, for goal, pledge, outcomes, and the country fund raising campaigns were held. The goal of the analysis is get information about
1. Outcomes of the campaign in realtion to the date the events were held for theater category
2. Outcomes of the campaigns on the goals for the whole dataset

# Analysis and Challenges

**Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

As part of an analysis, the data were grouped on the monthly basis for all the years 2009 through 2017 and drilled on the outcome basis to categorize it on base of the outcomes, such as "successful", "failed", and "canceled". The purpose of this analysis is to get the information on which time of the year most fund raising campaigns are held and it's success rate for "Theater" category using the line plot. 

I didn't encounter any challenges during analyzing data per instructions but looking at it from very high level, if I was being presented, in my opinion it would be more clearer to see the outcomes based on the percentage rate than just the number of counts.

**Outcomes Based on Goals**

For this analysis the goals were grouped in different intervals, minimum being less than 1,000 and maximum for more than 50,000. Then the outcomes were counted to caluculate percetage rate of success and failure. This does paints a clearer picture of how outcome rate to make a decision in the future on when to held more fund raising events versus when to invest less time and effort. 


# Conclusion

**Outcomes based on Launch Date**

Average success rate through out the year is 60% whereas May and June have the highest success rate in camparison to rest of the months, which I believe can be attributed to weather. On the other hand, there is a positive correlation of 0.80 between number of successful campaign and number of failed, which leads us to believe that greater the total number of campaign events are held more like to to have out come of success and failure - on average of 36%.

**Outcomes based on Goals** 

Among all the amount interval of goals, most successful campaing held falls under interval of 1,000 - 4,999 goal with the count of 388 out of 694.

The first recommendation I would make is do analysis on pledge than the goal because it is the money that would be funded, which will help us set goals in the future. I would make a recommendations of various visualitzations such as bar graph of goals and pledge on yearly basis so that we can see the trend.  I would also clarify if the amount in goals and pledges for the campaign held in Great Britain were the converted amount.  Another analysis to perform will be based on all categories to see which ones are more successful than other.
